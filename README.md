# Description
This repository is a demonstration of how to establish and communicate with an online MongoDB database in the Python environment.

# Prerequisites
A running MongoDB database at mongodb.com is needed to be set up before running the codes from this repository.

# Files and Their Descriptions

## mongo_example.ipynb
This is the main example of how to connect and upload to an existing MongoDB database.

## download_database.ipynb
A convenient notebook to do a quick inspection of the a collection.

## mongo_helper.ipynb
This is a legacy file that I brought over from another project. This file demonstrate the good coding practice that we should follow. Ideally, all functions defined within mongo_example.ipynb should be written in this helper file.
